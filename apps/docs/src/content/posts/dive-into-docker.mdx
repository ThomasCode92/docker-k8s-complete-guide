In this article, we'll explore Docker, its role in software development, and why
it's widely used. We'll break down the concept of images and their relationship
to containers. Additionally, we'll walk through the process of creating and
running a simple Docker container.

## What and Why Docker?

As a developer, you often need to set up software on your machine, whether it's

installer, but an error appears. After troubleshooting, you try again, only to
encounter another error. This leads to a cycle of troubleshooting and retrying
until the installation is successful.
