In this article, we'll explore Docker, its role in software development, and why
it's widely used. We'll break down the concept of images and their relationship
to containers. Additionally, we'll walk through the process of creating and
running a simple Docker container.

## What and Why Docker?

As a developer, you often need to set up software on your machine, whether it's
a web server, a database, or another program. You download and run the
installer, but an error appears. After troubleshooting, you try again, only to
encounter another error. This leads to a cycle of troubleshooting and retrying
until the installation is successful. This is the exact problem Docker solves.

**Why use Docker?** Docker makes it really easy to install and run software
without worring about setup and dependencies.

**What is Docker?** Docker is a platform designed for creating and running
_containers_. Its ecosystem includes several components, such as the _Docker
Client_, _Docker Server_, _Docker Machine_, _Docker Images_, _Docker Hub_, and
_Docker Compose_, among others. These tools work together to simplify
containerized application development and deployment.

## Install Docker

Docker is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can find the installation
options for your operating system on the
[Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/). To check if
docker is installed, run the following command in your terminal:
`docker --version`. If it shows a version number, you're good to go!

## Docker Client

<Image src={docker_client} alt="docker client" class="mx-auto" />

When trying to run a Container from an image, the _Docker Cleint_ reaches out to
the _Docker Server_ to check if the image is available. The _Docker Server_ will
then check if the image is available locally. If not, it will download the image
from _Docker Hub_ (a public repository for Docker images). Once the image is
downloaded, the _Docker Server_ will create a container from the image.
